I'm a dynamic mobile app developer with 3 years of experience in native Android and Flutter development. Passionate about crafting user-centric solutions, I'm dedicated to staying at the forefront of technology.

Alongside my development work, I run a YouTube channel where I host podcasts with guests from over 30 countries, exploring diverse perspectives and insights from around the world. I find immense joy in sharing knowledge and experiences, both in the realm of technology and beyond.
